# The athlete profile

The coach reads two kinds of thing about you:

- **Live numbers** — FTP, weight, paces, swim CSS, HRV, training load — pulled **live** from AI
  Endurance and Garmin every sync. These change constantly and the platforms own them.
- **Stable context** — body and biomechanics, kit, medical notes, availability, fuelling, your own
  race targets. No training API holds this. It lives in the **athlete profile**.

This page documents the profile: the two-file model, the schema, the `get_profile` tool, the computed
`dose_cycle`, and the hard rule that **live numbers never live in the profile**.

## Two-file privacy split

| File | Committed? | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `profile.example.yaml` | **yes** | the blank template with explanatory comments — what new users copy |
| `profile.local.yaml` | **no** (gitignored) | your real data; loaded in preference to the example |

The loader resolves `COACH_PROFILE_PATH` (if set) → `profile.local.yaml` → `profile.example.yaml`, so a
fresh clone still works (it just reads the blank template). The file is YAML-parsed and validated
against the schema on load; an invalid profile **fails loudly** with a clear message (the `get_profile`
tool surfaces it), while the ambient coaching-context injection degrades silently if the profile is
absent or invalid (never blocks a flow).

`profile.local.yaml` and `profile.local.*` are in `.gitignore`. As with all personal data here, it
never goes in git.

## Setup

```bash
cd /Users/maxeskell/dev/personal-training-app && npm run profile:init     # copy template + walk required fields
```

`npm run setup` also offers this step. The intake copies `profile.example.yaml` to
`profile.local.yaml` and prompts for the **required** fields, validating as it goes:

- `identity.name`, `identity.sex`, `identity.date_of_birth`, `identity.units`, `identity.timezone`
- `availability.weekly_hours`
- at least one race in `races` (with a name + date)

Everything else is optional — open `profile.local.yaml` and fill in biomechanics, equipment, fuelling
and medical context by hand. For a guided list of those optional fields with a plain-language question
and a one-line *why it helps the coach* for each, run **`npm run profile:questions`** (or read the
generated [docs/profile-questions.md](profile-questions.md)).

**Three ways to fill it — pick whichever suits you; all are optional and the coach works without any:**

1. **The wizard** — `npm run profile:init` (above), re-runnable any time. On an **existing** profile it's
   a **merge, not an overwrite**: your hand-entered blocks (biomechanics, medication, equipment, bike-fit,
   fuelling, notes) are kept and only the integration-sourced fields (identity, races, weekly hours) are
   refreshed — hand-written race notes are carried across by matching name/date. It never rebuilds from
   the blank template, and refuses rather than clobber a file it can't parse.
2. **By hand** — edit `profile.local.yaml` in your editor.
3. **By talking to Claude** — the MCP `update_profile` tool lets Claude write your answers straight into
   `profile.local.yaml` (deep-merged onto what's there, validated, live numbers rejected). Tell Claude
   *"add my medication: 5mg on Sundays, GI trough Tue–Thu"* and it patches the file. Always available to
   **Claude Desktop / Code** (local); on **Cowork** (cloud) it's off until you set
   `COACH_MCP_PROFILE_WRITE=true` — since that lets a remote session write a file on your Mac. See
   [docs/mcp-server.md](mcp-server.md) → `update_profile`.

### Integration bootstrap — pre-fill from your connected account

`profile:init` doesn't ask cold. It first assembles today's state from your **connected integrations**
(AI Endurance, plus Garmin if enabled — the same best-effort `buildTodayState()` the coach uses) and
**pre-fills** the intake, so you only confirm or override what it pulled, and only get *asked* for what
no integration holds. The pull is best-effort: if AI Endurance is unreachable or you haven't authed
yet, it **degrades cleanly** to the full manual flow (and says so), never crashing.

| Field | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `identity.name`, `identity.sex` | **AI Endurance** `getUser` (sex normalised to the `male/female/other` enum) |
| `identity.units`, `identity.timezone` | your **`.env`** (`COACH_UNITS` mapped to `metric`/`imperial`; `COACH_TZ`) |
| `races[]` | **AI Endurance** goal calendar — *all upcoming* races, soonest first, with priority, an inferred distance and a readable `target_time` (e.g. `sub 5:00:00`) |
| `availability.weekly_hours` | **MODEL estimate** from your recent training volume (see below) |
| `identity.date_of_birth` | **Garmin** `get_user_profile` (`birthDate`) when Garmin is enabled — else **asked** (AI Endurance exposes `age`, not DOB) |
| `identity.height_cm` | **Garmin** `get_user_profile` (`height`, normalised to cm) when Garmin is enabled — else left blank/hand-edited |
| biomechanics · health · medication · equipment · fuelling | **not pulled** — no integration holds these; hand-edit them after |

A transparent summary prints first ("From AI Endurance: name, sex, 3 upcoming races. From Garmin: date
of birth, height. From your .env: units, timezone…") so it's always clear what was pulled and from
where, then it asks **"Does this look right? [Y/n]"**:

- **Y** — keep everything pulled and only prompt for the **required** fields still genuinely missing
  (e.g. DOB when Garmin didn't supply it, or your first race). The optional `height` is kept as pulled.
- **n** — the per-field flow: every prompt shows the pulled value as its default, so **Enter keeps it**
  or you type to override.

Nothing is invented: a field an integration doesn't expose is simply asked (if required) or left blank.

> **DOB + height come from Garmin, not AI Endurance.** AI Endurance's `getUser` exposes your *age* but
> not your date of birth, and holds no height. Garmin's `get_user_profile` (the
> [Taxuspt/garmin_mcp](https://github.com/Taxuspt/garmin_mcp) user-profile tool → python-garminconnect
> `get_user_profile()`) holds both as **stable identity**. They're normalised — `birthDate` → `YYYY-MM-DD`,
> `height` → whole cm — and added with source `garmin`. **Weight is NOT taken** even though Garmin holds
> it: weight is a *live* number, pulled live and rejected by the no-live-numbers guard. With Garmin
> disabled (or down) the enrichment degrades — DOB falls back to being asked and height is left blank.

**Weekly hours is a MODEL estimate.** It groups your recent activities (trailing ~8 weeks) by ISO week,
drops the partial current week and any zero-volume weeks, takes the **median** representative week and
presents a ±0.5h band (e.g. `10-11`) — labelled a MODEL estimate per the *honest models* convention.
You accept it with Enter or override. If there isn't at least one full week of data to estimate from,
it falls back to **asking**. (It's a planning band for `availability.weekly_hours`, never a live number
— actual load stays live in AI Endurance.)

**Date of birth is auto-filled from Garmin, else asked.** The profile stores DOB (not age) so age stays
correct as time passes. When Garmin is enabled and supplies a `birthDate` it's pre-filled; otherwise
AI Endurance's `getUser` exposes only your `age`, so DOB is asked — with the API-derived age shown next
to the prompt as a sanity hint.

## The schema (stable context only)

Top-level blocks (all optional except `schema_version` and `identity`):

`identity` · `biomechanics` · `health` (incl. `medication`) · `bloods` · `availability` · `equipment` ·
`bike_fit` · `fuelling` · `races` · `ai_endurance_todo` · `open_items`.

Validation is strict on the **contract** — enum domains (`sex`, `units`, race `priority`/`distance`,
weekday names), `YYYY-MM-DD` dates, `schema_version` — and **permissive** on the free-form blocks
(`biomechanics`, `equipment`, `bike_fit`, `fuelling`), so a richly-detailed real profile isn't
rejected. The blank example and a fully-filled profile both validate. See `src/profile/schema.ts`.

### No live numbers — enforced

A guard walks the whole profile on load and **throws** if a live-performance key holds a live number.
It matches the key's underscore/camelCase **segments** (not raw substrings), covering `ftp`, `css`,
`vo2(max)`, `hrv`, `hr`/`rhr`/`resting_hr`/`max_hr`/`lthr`, `pace`, `threshold`, `weight`/`weight_kg`,
`ctl`/`atl`/`tsb`/`tss`, `w_per_kg`, `training_load` and `load_ratio`. A value trips it when it's a
number **or a purely-numeric string** (`"223"`), so a live number can't sneak in as text — but genuine
status strings stay fine (`ftp_w: unresolved`, `swim_css: not_set`), which is exactly the
`ai_endurance_todo` block and why those values must be set **in AI Endurance**, not here.
Equipment/fit/fuelling numbers are untouched — segment matching means `crank_length_mm`,
`saddle_height_mm`, `carb_target_g_per_hour`, `lightweight_wheels` and a kit `weight_g` all pass; a
stray `ftp_w: 223` (or `threshold_w: 240`) anywhere does not.

**Height vs weight.** `identity.height_cm` is allowed to be a number — height is *stable anthropometry*,
not a live performance metric (it's what the Garmin enrichment fills). **Weight is denied**: it changes
daily, is pulled live, and a numeric weight anywhere in the profile trips the guard.

**Bike race weight is the kit exception.** A *bike's* mass is stable kit, not a live number, so each
`equipment.bikes.<name>.race_weight_g` records the bike as-raced (incl. the bottle(s) you weighed it
with) in **grams** — `weight_g` passes the guard where a `weight_kg`/`weight` would be rejected as rider
bodyweight. `renderProfileContext` surfaces it in the live coaching block, and `systemWeightKg`
(`src/profile/equipment.ts`) combines it with the **live** rider weight from `get_state` into total
system weight (rider + bike) — the input a tyre-pressure chart needs. The rider half stays live by
design; only the bike half is stored.

### Bloods — dated snapshots (the numbers exception)

`bloods.panels` is a list of dated blood-panel snapshots, and it's the one place the profile holds
clinical numbers — deliberately. The no-live-numbers rule exists because FTP/weight/HRV/… are *owned by
a live API*; storing them here would shadow the live truth. **No training API holds your bloods**, so a
dated snapshot isn't a duplicate — it's stable context that lives nowhere else. Each panel is:

```yaml
bloods:
  panels:
    - date: 2020-11-06                    # YYYY-MM-DD the sample was drawn (required for the age nudge)
      source: Medichecks Well Man UltraVit
      markers:                            # free-form name_unit → number; record only what you care about
        ferritin_ug_l: 70.2
        vitamin_d_nmol_l: 67.8
      flags: ["haematocrit high-normal"]  # optional free-text
      notes: ["vitamin D low-normal; advised 400-800 IU/day"]
```

Two honesty guarantees:

- **Always reported as a snapshot, never as current.** `renderProfileContext` surfaces only the *latest*
  panel — its date, **age** (`~N months ago`), flags and notes — and a pointer to `get_profile` for the
  full marker values. Raw marker numbers are **not** dumped into the compact coaching block. Once the
  latest panel is **over a year old** it carries a *consider a re-test* nudge, so a stale value can't be
  mistaken for a fresh one. Full detail (every marker, every panel) is in the `get_profile` output.
- **The guard still runs.** A blood marker is just a number under a `name_unit` key, so it passes — but if
  a *live*-metric key (e.g. `resting_hr`, `vo2max`) is planted among the markers it's still rejected,
  exactly as anywhere else in the profile. Keep marker keys to genuine lab analytes.

## `get_profile` (MCP) and `dose_cycle`

`get_profile` returns the validated profile plus a computed `dose_cycle`. It's deterministic
(no LLM cost) and read-only, so it's available even on the read-only Cowork surface.

`dose_cycle` is derived on read from today's date + `health.medication.dose_day` + `gi_trough_days`:

```json
{ "dose_day": "sunday", "days_since_dose": 4, "in_gi_trough": true, "gi_trough_days": ["tuesday","wednesday","thursday"] }
```

- `days_since_dose` — whole days since the most recent dose weekday (0 on dose day).
- `in_gi_trough` — whether today's weekday falls in the configured GI-trough window.

"Today" (and therefore the dose weekday and your age) is resolved in your timezone: `COACH_TZ` if set,
otherwise `identity.timezone` from the profile, otherwise `Europe/London`. So setting
`identity.timezone` is enough — you only need `COACH_TZ` to temporarily override it (e.g. travelling).

It's `null` when no `medication.dose_day` is set. This lets the coach keep the hardest and longest
sessions off the GI-trough days and stay alert to under-fuelling — **the medication's drug, dose and
timing are the prescriber's call; the coach works *around* it.** The same context (medication,
biomechanics, availability, fuelling, race targets) is injected into the app's own coaching flows
(readiness, weekly, race, ask) when a profile is present. That injection is **in-memory only** —
`StateStore.save` strips the profile before writing, so the medical/personal data never lands in
`data/state/*.json` regardless of when a flow saves.

## What this app cannot do

This connector is **read-only to AI Endurance**. It cannot set your **swim CSS or FTP** there — set
those directly in the AI Endurance app. The `ai_endurance_todo` block is a reminder of what's unset,
not a write path; any entry with a non-empty value (e.g. `swim_css: not_set`) surfaces on the
dashboard's **Set up & improve** card (display-only, hidden from the shared view), and clears once it's
set to `resolved` or removed. Two things set it to `resolved` for you: clicking **✓ Done** on the card
(see below), or the **auto-resolve** — once the matching live number is synced from AI Endurance (a
**swim CSS** lands in `thresholds.swimCssSecPer100`), the task drops on the next sync without any edit.
(Swim CSS is read whether AI Endurance returns it as a **pace string** like `1:52` or a speed; if
`getUser` doesn't expose it at all, set **`COACH_SWIM_CSS`** — `m:ss` or seconds — as a manual fallback.)
(FTP is **not** auto-resolved: its `ftp_w` gap is a Garmin-vs-AIE *disagreement*, not an absence, so a
present value doesn't mean it's settled.) **Race target times are NOT an `ai_endurance_todo` item** — AI
Endurance has no field for them, so they can't be "set" there; they live in `races[].target_time` and
the coach reads them from the profile, so the card only ever shows things you can actually action.

That card is a small, deterministic (no-AI) action hub in three sections:

- **Finish setup** — the AI-Endurance gaps above, your free-text `open_items` (tagged *discuss with
  coach*), any unfilled optional profile questions (tagged *edit profile*), a few **integration-health**
  nudges (tagged *in your setup* — a missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, a long-stale sync, no open-water
  temperature set yet) and any **named race that has no date yet** (tagged *edit profile*). **Ranked by
  value** — AI-Endurance gaps and open items outrank profile questions, and a field the coach actually
  reads outranks a reference-only one.
- **This week** — the deterministic *marginal-gains* tweaks (the same selection the `tune` flow phrases
  up, computed live so it's always current and LLM-free), plus the **action items parsed from your most
  recent weekly review's "Next week" section** (or a pointer to it when there's no parseable section).
- **Worth considering** — items parsed from your most recent **research digest** (`knowledge/pending/`).
  Each expands to **what the research found** (the proposed prior), its **source**, a link to **read the
  full digest** in-app (`/digest`), and the **exact `approve` command with the real file name** — plus the
  honest reminder that these are priors to weigh, not verdicts (your own n=1 data outranks the textbook).

The last two sections **read your last saved reports** — the dashboard never re-runs the weekly or
research (LLM) flows — so each of their items carries an *"as of …"* tag and drops once the report is
stale (≈10 days for the weekly review, ≈45 for research). Everything is deduped (a weekly tweak that
restates a setup item collapses, finish-setup winning) and capped per section, so the card stays a calm
prompt, not a backlog. **Each item expands to a concrete, copy-pasteable proposed action** — exactly how
to do it (set it in AI Endurance, the dot-path + the three ways to fill a profile field, the `.env` line
to add, etc.) — so the card is self-serve without opening other docs. Each Finish-setup task carries
**three distinct actions** (recorded in the decision log, the same machinery as insight feedback):
**✓ Done** (hidden for good — and for an AI-Endurance gap it's also written `resolved` back into
`profile.local.yaml`, so it survives rebuilds), **💤 Snooze** (hidden ~2 weeks, then it can resurface)
and **🚫 Ignore** (dropped for good, profile untouched). A dismissed item stays gone and the freed slot
is taken by the next-best item in that section.

## The coaching brief is separate

The default coaching behaviour ships as a **prompt**, not data:
[`coach-instructions.md`](../coach-instructions.md) at the repo root (the app falls back to
[`docs/specs/AI_Triathlon_Coach_Project_Instructions.md`](specs/AI_Triathlon_Coach_Project_Instructions.md)
if it's absent). Keep it separate from your profile — edit the brief to change *how* the coach behaves,
edit the profile to change *what it knows about you*.
